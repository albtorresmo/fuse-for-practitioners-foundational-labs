== Use Case 4 : Authenticate and authorize the access to the A-MQ broker using a LDAP server

The purpose of this use case is to secure/restrict the access to the A-MQ Broker using a LDAP Server as backend system to host the users and their roles. This use case will extend the previously created use case.
2 users will be created (admin, jdoe) and they will be associated to different A-MQ roles (admin, write & read) in order to manage using the authorization plugin the operation they could perform on the queues; create, publish or read.
.

During this use case development, you will extend the existing LDIF created for the Apache Directory LDAP server in order to add the entries required to restrict the access to the queues usecase-input, usecase-error and usecase-output.
The user "John Doe - jdoe" which is part of the "users" group will be associated to the roles (admin, write and read) in order top be able to perform the required operation executed by the different Apache Camel Routes.
You will also configure accordingly the A-MQ Broker XML file in order to use the JAAS LDAP Plugin and the Cached LDAP Authorization plugin required to secure A-MQ.

.Goals
* Secure the A-MQ Broker
* Externalize the credentials, roles and access within a LDAP server
* Use JAAS & LDAP plugin to authenticate the users connected to the broker
* Restrict the access and the operations to be performed on the destination (admin, write, read) using the ActiveMQ Cached LDAP authorization plugin
* Design a unit test to validate the operations that a user could perform

== Import the Project (TODO - Discuss how we will setup the project)

. In JBoss Developer Studio, switch to the *Git* perspective. 
. Click the icon at the top to clone a Git repository and add the clone to this view.
. In the *URI* text box, copy and paste the following: 
+
------
https://github.com/gpe-mw-training/fuse-for-practitioners-labs.git
------
+
. Switch to *Project Explorer* for the *JBoss* perspective.
. Import a new Maven project by selecting *File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects -> Next*. Import the `core` and it's parent project
. Navigate to the location of the Git projects for the Data Transformation tool and click *Finish*.
. Click the *Project Explorer* tab and expand the `Inbound` project node. 
+  
.Application structure
image::images/application_structure.png[width="40%"]

. Examine the following files and folders that appear in the expanded view:

* `routing`: module in which you will develop the `route`, `unit test` of the use-case.
** `src/main/resources/schema` : JSON and csv schemas files you will need to create the Data Transformation
* `parent` : Contain JBoss Fuse 6.2.1 dependencies, properties definition and maven plugins used by the modules
* `features` : Apache Karaf XML features file to be used to deploy the `usecase` project on JBoss Fuse without Fabric technology

=== Configure H2 Database

* Download [H2 DB](http://www.h2database.com/html/download.html) - Tested with 1.4.190 locally
* Unzip the content and open a terminal
* Launch it `./h2-1.4.190/bin/h2.sh`
* Within your browser `http://localhost:8082/login.jsp`, setup the connection

* Create the DB (if not yet done) using the `routing/src/main/resources/schema/db/usecaseDB.sql` script and run these commands within the browser

=== Configure the Camel ActiveMQComponent and d the connectionFactory

In order to use locally the project, you will create a Spring XML file to setup a Broker. The Broker configuration must include the following paramaters

* SimpleAuthentication Plugin with the user `admin` assigned to the group `users,admins`. the password of the user is `admin`
* Transport Connector defined for the openwire / tcp transport protocol running on port `61616`
* Dead Letter Strategy implemented for the queues and having this prefix `DLQ.`

IMPORTANT: This spring XML file should be located under a different directory, then `META-INF/spring` to avoid that it will be used when deployed on JBoss Fuse as there is a by default Broker
installed

Configure the ActiveMQ Component to use a ConnectionFactory to call the broker on this address `tcp://localhost:61616` for the user `admin`

NOTE: If A JMS Transaction Manager is required, please use the Spring JmsTransactionManager class

WARNING: The Redelivery strategy will be defined using the ActiveMQ RedeliveryPolicy as requested within the usecase

=== Review the existing Camel Routes

As we will start this project from the usecase 1, you will reuse the code crated within this project in order to replace the
file component with the ActiveMQ component and different queues.

Update the keys within the `fabric8/route.properties` file to use the new endpoints

NOTE: Don't hesitate to create Camel Spring Junit Test case to validate the logic of your Camel Routes

=== Implement the interception strategy

Develop your interception strategy to fetch the `IllegalArgumentException` exception and move the information into a topic `usecase-error`
with the information requested into the usecase description `error-code` and `error-message`. The code of the error could be set to `111`
and the error message will correspond to the first message reported by the stack trace that Camel Bindy has throw.

NOTE: The string content of the message must be also saved into the JMS message as it will be used to update the T_ERROR table

TIP: You can create a `direct:error` route that you will call from your interception strategy

TIP : Don't hesitate to add some Log EIP processor to collect information using the Logging Level DEBUG and the logName `org.fuse.usecase`

=== Extend the existing Camel routes

Add a new route with an ActiveMQ endpoint to consume from the topic `usecase-error`, the JMS Messages received.
Develop from this route your strategy insert the a record with the information (code, error message and message, status) within
the table T_ERROR

=== Developp your strategy to inject the corrected message

Based on the information saved into the T_ERROR database, develop your strategy to inject the corrected message into the `usecase-input`
 queue.

WARNING: Don't forget to update the status according to the values defined (a new message haq the status equal to ERROR, when updated to FIXED
 and when it will be reinjected CLOSE)

=== Build the `routing` Project & test it locally

. On the command line, run the following commands

[source]
----
mvn clean install
mvn camel:run
----

. Demonstrate that your logic implemented is correct (records into the DB, messages within the queues, ...)

=== Bonus

Define the features XML file to deploy the project on JBoss Fuse 6.2.1 and test it using these commands to be executed within the Fuse console.

[source]
----
addurl mvn:org.fuse.usecase3/features/1.0/xml/features
features:install usecase-dlq-jms
----

Instead of using the features XML file, you can also create a Fabric8 profile by editing the <fabric8.xxxx> xml tags that you have within the pom.xml routing file
and next execute this command to create the profile into JBoss Fuse Fabric

[source]
----
mvn fabric8:deploy
----

=== Useful SQL scripts

[source]
----
INSERT INTO USECASE.T_ACCOUNT (CLIENT_ID,SALES_CONTACT,COMPANY_NAME,COMPANY_GEO,COMPANY_ACTIVE,CONTACT_FIRST_NAME,CONTACT_LAST_NAME,CONTACT_ADDRESS,CONTACT_CITY,CONTACT_STATE,CONTACT_ZIP,CONTACT_PHONE,CREATION_DATE,CREATION_USER) VALUES ('95','Rachel Cassidy','MountainBikers','SOUTH_AMERICA',true,'George','Jungle','1101 Smith St.','Raleigh','NC','27519','919-555-0800','2015-12-15','fuse_usecase');

DELETE FROM USECASE.T_ACCOUNT;
DELETE FROM USECASE.T_ERROR;

SELECT * FROM USECASE.T_ACCOUNT;
SELECT * FROM USECASE.T_ERROR;

UPDATE USECASE.T_ERROR SET MESSAGE='Error,EU,true,Fred,Quicksand,202 Barney Blvd.,Rock City,MI,19728,313-555-1234', STATUS='FIXED' WHERE ID=8;

DROP SCHEMA USECASE;
