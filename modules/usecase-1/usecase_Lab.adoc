== Use Case 1 - Camel Route with CSV/Bindy Dataformat & DataMapper Tool to transform the Java objects

The purpose of the use case is to develop some Apache Camel pipeline routes where we will process CSV files, read the CSV records and transform the records to Java Objects.
Next, we will split the List of the Java Objects to enhance each Java Object using the JBoss Fuse Data Mapper tool. The java object enhanced will be finally transformed into a JSON String that you will
save into a file.

The DLQ pattern must be implemented to move the "erroneous" CSV records into an error folder (using Exception Strategy and DLQErrorHandler).

.Goals
* Build an Apache Camel route to consume CSV files and transform the records into Java Objects using the Bindy Transformation component
* Split the list of the Java Objects received and apply a Java to Java transformation using the Fuse Data Mapper Tool (from org.acme.Customer to org.globex.Account)
* Map the fields as defined within the table
* Transform the Java object created (= org.globex.Account) into individual JSON file
* Implement the DLQ Pattern to move the erroneous CSV record(s) into an error folder
* Design a unit test to validate the data transformations of the CSV message to JSON

== Import the Project (TODO - Discuss how we will setup the project)

include::../common/instructions.adoc[]

=== Create the Model class

Use the `src/main/resources/schema/csv/customer.csv` file containing the definition of a CSV record to create the Java class `org.acme.Customer`. The csv fields must be associated
to Java fields based on the type defined within the csv schema. The position of the field corresponds also to the position of the csv column within the csv record. Specify to Bindy
that the separator to be used is `,`.

The camel-bindy component is required to compile the code

=== Develop the Routing module

Develop the Apache Camel route consuming the CSV records files and split the content using as token the carriage return character.
The correctly splitted messages should be send the outbox file endpoint.

File uri inbox endpoint : src/data/inbox?fileName=customers.csv&amp;noop=true
File uri outbox endpoint : src/data/outbox?fileName=csv-record-${date:now:yyyyMMdd}.txt

=== Define the csv2json data transformation

Within the Fuse Camel editor, drag and drop a "Data Transformation" endpoint to create, using the wizard, a csv2json transformation. Use as input format the Customer Java class created previously and select the
target model using the `acount.json` file located under the directory `src/main/resources/schema/json/account.json`.

When the data transformation file has been created, then edit the file to map the Customer fields with their corresponding fields created within the Account, Company and Contact classes.

NOTE: By default, the tool will generate the classes under the package name `account` for the json model. You can rename the package to by example `org.globex` instead of the `account` name. If you change the package name, then
it will be required that you also edit the transformation file to change the location of the classB (= target model) like also the targetModel field within the endpoint added within the Apache Camel Route.

WARNING: As the csv input source is not available as source when you generate the data mapping, then the Bindy dataformat has not been added within the <DataFormats> xml tag of the Apachz Camel
route. So edit the code source of the Apache Camel route to add the <bindy /> xml tag with the following parameters : id = csv, type = csv and classType="org.acme.Customer".
Update also the endpoint definition to use this csv data format to unmarshall the content. So, add a unmarshalId parameter.

=== Use the Data Transformation Endpoint

Update the Apache Camel Route to include the data transformation endpoint after the exchanges have been splitted.

=== Add a DLQ strategy

Implement the DLQ pattern using the onException interceptor and move the faulty exchanged to a file error endpoint.

File uri error endpoint : src/data/error?fileName=account-${property.CamelSplitIndex}.json
Exception type to be tracked by the onException interceptor : java.lang.IllegalArgumentException

=== Develop the JUnit Test

Develop a Junit Test case to validate the csv2json data transformation. Add a new Apache Camel route to produce using the direct component an exchange containing as Body
a customer csv record and send this exchange to the endpoint responsible to do the thransfoamtion ("csv2json"). the result of that transformation must be consumed by a mock endpoint

Name of the Junit Test class : ValidateTransformationTest
Mock endpoint uri : mock:csv2json-test-output
Direct endpoint uri : direct:csv2json-test-input

=== Build the `routing` Project & test it locally

. On the command line, run the following commands:

[source]
----
mvn clean install
mvn camel:run
----

=== Bonus

Define the features XML file to deploy the project on JBoss Fuse 6.2.1 and test it using these commands to be executed within the Fuse console.

[source]
----
addurl mvn:org.fuse.usecase/features/1.0/xml/features
features:install usecase-camel-bindy-json
----

Instead of using the features XML file, you can also create a Fabric8 profile by editing the <fabric8.xxxx> xml tags that you have within the pom.xml routing file
and next execute this command to create the profile into JBoss Fuse Fabric

[source]
----
mvn fabric8:deploy
----
